## development/contribution
Windows only: To work on this style, you can run `npm run dev` after cloning & installing this repo - this will open the style in your browser & start watching for changes, recompiling when necessary.  
Otherwise, you can run `npm run watch` and open the script yourself from the `dist/` directory.

To automatically reload your style on changes, click on `Live reload` in the Stylus page that opens. Make sure not to close either the file or Stylus tabs that open, as auto reload will not work otherwise. Other extensions may have different ways of automatic reloads, or not support them outright.

## testing
You can test bleeding-edge versions by downloading the style from [automatic builds][workflows]. Click on any version you'd like (or just the latest one), and download the style from the artifacts section.
